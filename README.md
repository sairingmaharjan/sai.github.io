# Kanban History: From 1950s Factory Floor to Today’s Remote Teams
## Kanban System History: The Beginning
##
Kanban history has its origins in the Toyota Production System (TPS) [invented](https://kanbantool.com/kanban-guide/kanban-history) by Taiichi Ohno. A director who had come up through the machine shop, Ohno sought to eliminate waste on the production line. Two of the areas he identified were overproduction and inventory: It was wasteful to make too many cars, but also wasteful to have unused raw materials sitting on the factory floor. His solution drew inspiration from supermarket operations, where food is stocked according to demand.

Applying this principle to factory production proved relatively simple: For each new car, a card containing instructions and supply information would be attached to the product during assembly, and move with it throughout the production process. Once the car was sold, the card would be returned to the start of the chain. When a predetermined number of cards were waiting to be reassigned to a product, this would signal the need for new cars to enter production, triggering an order of materials from the warehouse. The cards, named kanbans after the Japanese word for signboard, provided a visual aid to track a task from start to finish. By 1963, Kanban was in use at all Toyota plants. The manufacturing industry at large would take notice of the method and decades later, these principles would be applied to software development.
### Kanban Board History: From the Factory Floor to the Whiteboard
## In 2010, Microsoft engineer David J. Anderson published Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business, which built on the work of Ohno and others to apply the principles of Kanban to software development. Central to this framework was the use of the Kanban board: This visual representation of a task’s journey through the production process reenvisioned the manufacturing model for software development. Instead of attaching the card to a physical object, the card is moved between one of several columns representing the task’s progress.

Anderson also laid out (and later expanded) core practices for Kanban:

Visualize the flow of work. This is where the Kanban board is used in practice; it works from the premise that a visible workflow is more manageable and more easily tracked among users.
Limit work in progress (WIP). By limiting the number of tasks a team or individual can handle at once, Kanban seeks to balance workloads and prevent burnout.
Manage flow. Kanban enables tasks to move through each stage in the workflow with speed and efficiency.
Make policies explicit. Kanban empowers teams with transparency; it helps individuals and teams understand how, why, and when work is done.
Implement feedback loops. A Kanban team makes regular process and policy adjustments based on the results of review sessions.
Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally. The combined effects of increased transparency from a visualized workflow and the regular self-assessment of feedback loops create an environment in which teams work together to improve performance.
These practices form the basis for adaptive capability; together, they create a system in which anyone on the team can see and understand the workflow, assess what’s working and what isn’t, and adjust priorities accordingly.
